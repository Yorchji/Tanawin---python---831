#Question 2: Enhanced Guessing Game with Hints
Develop an enhanced guessing game with intelligent hint system:
Core Features:

Random number between 1-100
Unlimited attempts

Progressive hint system:

    After 3 wrong guesses: Show if number is odd/even
    After 5 wrong guesses: Show if divisible by 3 or 5
    After 7 wrong guesses: Narrow the range to 25-number window
    บรรทัดที่13 ลดสโคปโดนการเลือก12ตัวก่อนหน้ารวมตัวที่สุ่มมาเป็น13ละตัวหลังอีก12เป็น25ตัว
    After 10 wrong guesses: Show first digit
    
Example 
    === Enhanced GUESSING GAME ===
    Guess my number between 1 and 100!
    You have unlimited attempts.

    Attempt 1 - Enter your guess: 10
    Too low! Try again.

    Attempt 2 - Enter your guess: 15
    Too high! Try again.

    Attempt 3 - Enter your guess: 12
    Too low! Try again.
    HINT: The number is even
    
    ...
    
    Attempt 5 - Enter your guess: 20
    Too high! Try again.
    HINT: The number is divisible by 5
    
    ...
    
    Congratulations! You won in 10 attempts!
